My code sample is a simple genetic algorithm that attempts to learn a chromosome of all 1’s. Genetic algorithms attempt to mimic survival of the fittest/natural selection. The key here is what defines “fit”. In this case, the chromosome has only 0’s and 1’s and the fitness is defined as the sum of the chromosome (all 1’s being ideal). However, it can be easily adapted to fit any scenario: for example, you could have a self driving robot. As long as the chromosome and fitness correspond to something useful (i.e. steering and not crashing), this algorithm will help find a solution.The initial population is randomly generated, and after that the fitter chromosomes are given a better chance of breeding. Breeding involves splicing the 2 parent chromosomes at a random point and creating 2 new children. To help insure that it doesn’t stall on a local maximum, there is a random chance of mutation during the breeding process. This algorithm currently goes until a perfect score is reached, however for less certain tasks a generation limit can be assigned. This means that the algorithm will keep breeding new populations, evaluating them, and then breeding again (creating new generations) for a specified period of time.
